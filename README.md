# ProjectSummary
A python script that goes through all files in your project main and sub directories, counts all the lines of code in the file extensions you specify and tells you how many lines of codes your project has.

### Running the script
Running the script main.py, you would be promted to enter the fullpath to the project directory
After that, you will need to enter the extentions you would like the program to read.

##### The script doesn't include empty lines when reading through the files in the project directory, only lines with actual code in it. I hope someone finds it helpful.
